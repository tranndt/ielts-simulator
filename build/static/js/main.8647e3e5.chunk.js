That might partly explain why, when employers are under pressure to cut costs, they persuade a 55-year old to take early retirement. Take away seniority-based pay scales, and older workers may become a much more attractive employment proposition. But most employers and many workers are uncomfortable with the idea of reducing someone\u2019s pay in later life \u2013although manual workers on piece-rates often earn less as they get older. So retaining the services of older workers may mean employing them in different ways.\\nOne innovation was devised by IBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and having decided to concentrate cuts on 55 to 60-year olds, IBM set up a separate company called Skill Team, which re-employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of 60. An employee who joined Skill Team at the age of 55 on a five-year contract would work for 58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services to IBM, thus allowing it to retain access to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have lost.\\nThe best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such \u2018bridge\u2019 jobs: part- time or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full-time work to retirement. Studies have found that, in the United States, nearly half of all men and women who had been in full-time jobs in middle age moved into such \u2018bridge\u2019 jobs at the end of their working lives. In general, it is the best-paid and worst-paid who carry on working. There seem to be two very different types of bridge job-holder \u2013 those who continue working because they have to and those who continue working because they want to, even though they could afford to retire.\\nIf the job market grows more flexible, the old may find more jobs that suit them. Often, they will be self-employed. Sometimes, they may start their own businesses: a study by David Storey of Warwick University found that in Britain 70% of businesses started by people over 55 survived, compared with an overall national average of only 19%. But whatever pattern of employment they choose, in the coming years the skills of these \u2018grey workers\u2019 will have to be increasingly acknowledged and rewarded","questionsList":[{"questionType":"multiple_choice","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 4\\nChoose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.\\nWrite the correct letter in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.\\n","questions":[{"questionNumber":1,"questionText":"In paragraph one, the writer suggests that companies could consider","questionOptions":[["A","abolishing pay schemes that are based on age."],["B","avoiding pay that is based on piece-rates."],["C","increasing pay for older workers."],["D","equipping older workers with new skills."]],"correctAnswer":["A","abolishing pay schemes that are based on age"]},{"questionNumber":2,"questionText":"Skill Team is an example of a company which","questionOptions":[["A","offers older workers increases in salary."],["B","allows people to continue working for as long as they want."],["C","allows the expertise of older workers to be put to use."],["D","treats older and younger workers equally."]],"correctAnswer":["C","allows the expertise of older workers to be put to use"]},{"questionNumber":3,"questionText":"According to the writer, \u2018bridge\u2019 jobs","questionOptions":[["A","tend to attract people in middle-salary ranges."],["B","are better paid than some full-time jobs."],["C","originated in the United States."],["D","appeal to distinct groups of older workers."]],"correctAnswer":["D","appeal to distinct groups of older workers"]},{"questionNumber":4,"questionText":"David Storey\u2019s study found that","questionOptions":[["A","people demand more from their work as they get older."],["B","older people are good at running their own businesses."],["C","an increasing number of old people are self-employed."],["D","few young people have their own businesses."]],"correctAnswer":["B","older people are good at running their own businesses"]}]}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Table Completion","taskSubtitle":"[Note: This is an extract from an Academic Reading passage on the subject of dung beetles.

The beetles immediately disappear beneath the pats digging and tunnelling and, if they successfully adapt to their new environment, soon become a permanent, self-sustaining part of the local ecology. In time they multiply and within three or four years the benefits to the pasture are obvious.\\nDung beetles work from the inside of the pat so they are sheltered from predators such as birds and foxes. Most species burrow into the soil and bury dung in tunnels directly underneath the pats, which are hollowed out from within. Some large species originating from France excavate tunnels to a depth of approximately 30 cm below the dung pat.\\nThese beetles make sausage-shaped brood chambers along the tunnels. The shallowest tunnels belong to a much smaller Spanish species that buries dung in chambers that hang like fruit from the branches of a pear tree. South African beetles dig narrow tunnels of approximately 20 cm below the surface of the pat. Some surface-dwelling beetles, including a South African species, cut perfectly-shaped balls from the pat, which are rolled away and attached to the bases of plants.\\nFor maximum dung burial in spring, summer and autumn, farmers require a variety of species with overlapping periods of activity. In the cooler environments of the state of Victoria, the large French species (2.5 cms long), is matched with smaller (half this size), temperate-climate Spanish species. The former are slow to recover from the winter cold and produce only one or two generations of offspring from late spring until autumn. The latter, which multiply rapidly in early spring, produce two to five generations annually. The South African ball-rolling species, being a sub-tropical beetle, prefers the climate of northern and coastal New South Wales where it commonly works with the South African tunneling species. In warmer climates, many species are active for longer periods of the year.\\nGlossary1. dung: the droppings or excreta of animals.\\n2. cow pats: droppings of cows.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"table_completion","taskDescription":"Question 9 \u2013 13\\nComplete the table below.\\nChoose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.\\nWrite your answers in boxes 9-13 on your answer sheet.\\n","questionContent":[["Species","Size","Preferred climate","Complementary species","Start of active period","Number of generations per year"],["French","2.5 cm","cool","Spanish","late spring","1 - 2"],["Spanish","1.25 cm","[9]","","[10]","[11]"],["South African ball roller","","[12]","[13]","",""]],"questions":[{"questionNumber":9,"correctAnswer":"temperate"},{"questionNumber":10,"correctAnswer":"early spring"},{"questionNumber":11,"correctAnswer":"two to five / 2-5"},{"questionNumber":12,"correctAnswer":"sub-tropical"},{"questionNumber":13,"correctAnswer":"South African tunneling/tunnelling"}]}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Matching Headings","taskSubtitle":"[Note: This is an extract from a Part 2 text about the physics of traffic behaviour.]\xa9 2000 The Atlantic Media Co., as first published in The Atlantic Magazine. All rights reserved. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.\\n","passageTitle":"The Physics of Traffic Behavior","passageSubtitle":"","passageText":"A Some years ago, when several theoretical physicists, principally Dirk Helbing and Boris Kerner of Stuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in publications normally read by traffic engineers, they were clearly working outside their usual sphere of investigation. They had noticed that if they simulated the movement of vehicles on a highway, using the equations that describe how the molecules of a gas move, some very strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not behave exactly like gas molecules: for example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when they get too near another vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the physicists modified the equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of traffic as a flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic reproduces many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.\\nThe strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the implication that congestion can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary. Vehicles can be flowing freely along, at a density still well below what the road can handle, and then suddenly gel into a slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief and local fluctuation in the speed or the distance between vehicles is all it takes to trigger a system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. In fact, the physicists\u2019 analysis suggested such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably occur quite frequently on highways.\\nB Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to the phenomena popularized as \u2018chaos theory\u2019. This theory has arisen from the understanding that in any complex interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the others. Consequently, tiny variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge but unpredictable ways. This type of dramatic change from one state to another is similar to what happens when a chemical substance changes from a vapor to a liquid. It often happens that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after its temperature and density have reached the point where it could condense into water droplets. However, if the vapor encounters a solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, condensation can take place and the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and Kerner see traffic as a complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic density can act as the \u2018speck of dust\u2019 causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to synchronized traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the same speed, making passing impossible.\\nC The physicists have challenged proposals to set a maximum capacity for vehicles on highways. They argue that it may not be enough simply to limit the rate at which vehicles are allowed to enter a highway, rather, it may be necessary to time each vehicle\u2019s entry onto a highway precisely to coincide with a temporary drop in the density of vehicles along the road. The aim of doing this would be to smooth out any possible fluctuations in the road conditions that can trigger a change in traffic behavior and result in congestion. They further suggest that preventing breakdowns in the flow of traffic could ultimately require implementing the radical idea that has been suggested from time to time: directly regulating the speed and spacing of individual cars along a highway with central computers and sensors that communicate with each car\u2019s engine and brake controls.\\nD However, research into traffic control is generally centered in civil engineering departments and here the theories of the physicists have been greeted with some skepticism. Civil engineers favor a practical approach to problems and believe traffic congestion is the result of poor road construction (two lanes becoming one lane or dangerous curves), which constricts the flow of traffic. Engineers questioned how well the physicists\u2019 theoretical results relate to traffic in the real world. Indeed, some engineering researchers questioned whether elaborate chaos-theory interpretations are needed at all, since at least some of the traffic phenomena the physicists\u2019 theories predicted seemed to be similar to observations that had been appearing in traffic engineering literature under other names for years; observations which had straightforward cause-and-effect explanations.\\nE James Banks, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at San Diego State University in the US, suggested that a sudden slowdown in traffic may have less to do with chaos theory than with driver psychology. As traffic gets heavier and the passing lane gets more crowded, aggressive drivers move to other lanes to try to pass, which also tends to even out the speed between lanes. He also felt that another leveling force is that when a driver in a fast lane brakes a little to maintain a safe distance between vehicles, the shock wave travels back much more rapidly than it would in the other slower lanes, because each following driver has to react more quickly. Consequently, as a road becomes congested, the faster moving traffic is the first to slow down.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"matching_headings","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 4\\nReading Passage 1 has five sections, A-E.\\nChoose the correct heading for each section from the list of headings below.\\nWrite the correct number, i-viii, in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.\\n","headingsList":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"exampleAnswer":"Example Section B i\\n","questions":[{"questionNumber":1,"questionText":"Section A","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"]},{"questionNumber":2,"questionText":"Section C","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]},{"questionNumber":3,"questionText":"Section D","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"]},{"questionNumber":4,"questionText":"Section E","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["vii","The impact of driver behavior on traffic speed"]}]}]}')},,,,,function(e,t,a){},,function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){},function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);a(0);var i=a(5),s=a.n(i),o=a(4),n=a(3),r=(a(14),a(1));var c=function(){return Object(r.jsx)("div",{className:"home-page",children:Object(r.jsxs)("div",{className:"jumbotron",children:[Object(r.jsx)("h1",{className:"display-4",children:"Welcome to the IELTS Test Simulator"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{className:"lead",children:"Prepare for your IELTS test with our simulator and get the practice you need to succeed."}),Object(r.jsx)("hr",{className:"my-4"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"This web app provides a realistic simulation of the IELTS test, allowing you to practice under test conditions.
