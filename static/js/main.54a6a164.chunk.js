That might partly explain why, when employers are under pressure to cut costs, they persuade a 55-year old to take early retirement. Take away seniority-based pay scales, and older workers may become a much more attractive employment proposition. But most employers and many workers are uncomfortable with the idea of reducing someone\u2019s pay in later life \u2013although manual workers on piece-rates often earn less as they get older. So retaining the services of older workers may mean employing them in different ways.\\nOne innovation was devised by IBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and having decided to concentrate cuts on 55 to 60-year olds, IBM set up a separate company called Skill Team, which re-employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of 60. An employee who joined Skill Team at the age of 55 on a five-year contract would work for 58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services to IBM, thus allowing it to retain access to some of the intellectual capital it would otherwise have lost.\\nThe best way to tempt the old to go on working may be to build on such \u2018bridge\u2019 jobs: part- time or temporary employment that creates a more gradual transition from full-time work to retirement. Studies have found that, in the United States, nearly half of all men and women who had been in full-time jobs in middle age moved into such \u2018bridge\u2019 jobs at the end of their working lives. In general, it is the best-paid and worst-paid who carry on working. There seem to be two very different types of bridge job-holder \u2013 those who continue working because they have to and those who continue working because they want to, even though they could afford to retire.\\nIf the job market grows more flexible, the old may find more jobs that suit them. Often, they will be self-employed. Sometimes, they may start their own businesses: a study by David Storey of Warwick University found that in Britain 70% of businesses started by people over 55 survived, compared with an overall national average of only 19%.

The beetles immediately disappear beneath the pats digging and tunnelling and, if they successfully adapt to their new environment, soon become a permanent, self-sustaining part of the local ecology. In time they multiply and within three or four years the benefits to the pasture are obvious.\\nDung beetles work from the inside of the pat so they are sheltered from predators such as birds and foxes. Most species burrow into the soil and bury dung in tunnels directly underneath the pats, which are hollowed out from within. Some large species originating from France excavate tunnels to a depth of approximately 30 cm below the dung pat.\\nThese beetles make sausage-shaped brood chambers along the tunnels. The shallowest tunnels belong to a much smaller Spanish species that buries dung in chambers that hang like fruit from the branches of a pear tree. South African beetles dig narrow tunnels of approximately 20 cm below the surface of the pat. Some surface-dwelling beetles, including a South African species, cut perfectly-shaped balls from the pat, which are rolled away and attached to the bases of plants.\\nFor maximum dung burial in spring, summer and autumn, farmers require a variety of species with overlapping periods of activity. In the cooler environments of the state of Victoria, the large French species (2.5 cms long), is matched with smaller (half this size), temperate-climate Spanish species. The former are slow to recover from the winter cold and produce only one or two generations of offspring from late spring until autumn. The latter, which multiply rapidly in early spring, produce two to five generations annually. The South African ball-rolling species, being a sub-tropical beetle, prefers the climate of northern and coastal New South Wales where it commonly works with the South African tunneling species. In warmer climates, many species are active for longer periods of the year.\\nGlossary\\n1. dung: the droppings or excreta of animals.\\n2. cow pats: droppings of cows.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"table_completion","taskDescription":"Question 9 \u2013 13\\nComplete the table below.\\nChoose NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS from the passage for each answer.\\nWrite your answers in boxes 9-13 on your answer sheet.\\n","questionContent":[["Species","Size","Preferred climate","Complementary species","Start of active period","Number of generations per year"],["French","2.5 cm","cool","Spanish","late spring","1 - 2"],["Spanish","1.25 cm","[9]","","[10]","[11]"],["South African ball roller","","[12]","[13]","",""]],"questions":[{"questionNumber":9,"correctAnswer":"temperate"},{"questionNumber":10,"correctAnswer":"early spring"},{"questionNumber":11,"correctAnswer":"two to five / 2-5"},{"questionNumber":12,"correctAnswer":"sub-tropical"},{"questionNumber":13,"correctAnswer":"South African tunneling/tunnelling"}]}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Note Completion","taskSubtitle":"","passageContext":"[Note: This is an extract from a Part 1 text about the scientist Marie Curie.]Adapted with permission from Encyclopaedia Britannica, \xa9 2007 by Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.\\n","passageTitle":"The life and work of Marie Curie","passageSubtitle":"","passageText":"The marriage of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance. Following Henri Becquerel\u2019s discovery in 1896 of a new phenomenon, which Marie later called \u2018radioactivity\u2019, Marie Curie decided to find out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this was true for thorium.\\nTurning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was achieved with the help of the chemist Andr\xe9-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie\u2019s pupils. Based on the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.\\nThe births of Marie\u2019s two daughters, Ir\xe8ne and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her scientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the \xc9cole Normale Sup\xe9rieure for girls in S\xe8vres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by Pierre Curie.\\nThe sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning point in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific work that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had been left vacant on her husband\u2019s death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the isolation of a pure form of radium.\\nDuring World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Ir\xe8ne, devoted herself to the development of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as \u2018Little Curies\u2019, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose staff Ir\xe8ne had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a centre for nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922, a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical applications.\\nIn 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United States to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the Curie Foundation in Paris, and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia became director.\\nOne of Marie Curie\u2019s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for research. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5 grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Ir\xe8ne and Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Joliot-Curie of artificial radioactivity. A few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. She had often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the pretty blue-green light they gave off.\\nHer contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work, the importance of which had been demonstrated by her two Nobel Prizes, but because of her influence on subsequent generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"note_completion","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 6\\nComplete the notes below.\\nChoose ONE WORD ONLY from the passage for each answer.

It used to be the case that all the features of organisms were important in working out their family tree. But following the work of German entomologist Willi Hennig, many evolutionary scientists now believe that the only features which carry any useful information are the evolutionary \u2018novelties\u2019 shared between organisms. Mice, lizards and fish, for example, all have backbones \u2013 so the feature \u2018backbone\u2019 tells us nothing about their evolutionary relationship. But the feature \u2018four legs\u2019 is useful because it\u2019s an evolutionary novelty \u2013 a characteristic shared only between the lizard and the mouse. This would suggest that the lizard and mouse are more closely related to each other than either is to the fish. This revolutionary approach is called cladistics, and it has been central to the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\\nThe \u2018birds are dinosaurs\u2019 theory was first developed by English palaeontologist Thomas Huxley (1825\u20131895). According to some accounts, one evening Huxley went to dinner still thinking about a mystery dinosaur bone in his lab. He knew he was dealing with the lower leg bone (tibia) of a meat-eating, two-legged dinosaur belonging to the classification known as theropods, but attached to the tibia was an unidentified extra bone. On the menu that evening was quail, a small bird similar to a pheasant, and Huxley noticed the same strange bone, attached to the quail tibia on his plate. He later realised that it was in fact the bird\u2019s anklebone. More importantly, Huxley concluded that its forms in both dinosaur and bird skeletons were so similar that they must be closely related.\\nHuxley\u2019s idea fell out of favour for fifty years following the 1916 publication of The Origin of Birds by the Danish doctor Gerhard Heilmann. During this time, Heilmann\u2019s theory was widely accepted. Heilmann had noted that two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs lacked collarbones. In later evolutionary stages these bones fuse together to form the distinctive \u2018Y\u2019- shaped bone in a bird\u2019s neck, known as the furcula. Heilmann proposed the notion that such a feature could not be lost and then re-evolve at a later date, so dinosaurs could not be the ancestors of birds.\\nThen, in the late 1960s, John Ostrom from Yale University in the US, noted 22 features in the skeletons of meat-eating dinosaurs that were also found in birds and nowhere else. This reset the thinking on bird ancestry and once again Huxley\u2019s ideas caught the attention of the scientific community. Subsequent work has found up to 85 characteristics that tie dinosaurs and birds together. But what of Heilmann\u2019s missing bones? It turns out that not only did many dinosaurs have collarbones, these were also fused together into a furcula. Unfortunately for Heilmann, the fossil evidence was somewhat lacking in his day, and the few furculae that had been found were misidentified, usually as belly ribsUS ornithologist Alan Feduccia and palaeontologist Larry Martin are two vocal opponents of the dinosaur theory. They contend that birds evolved from some unknown reptile at a time long before dinosaurs. Their reasoning is that flight is most likely to have started from a tree-climbing ancestor, yet all the proposed dinosaurian ancestors were ground-dwellers. But the dino-bird supporters contend that an unknown dinosaurian bird-ancestor could have been tree-dwelling, or that birds evolved flight from the ground up by chasing and leaping after insects. Most of Feduccia and Martin\u2019s case against the \u2018birds-are-dinosaurs\u2019 hypothesis is based on differences between birds and dinosaurs. Supporters of cladistics, however, maintain that differences between organisms do not matter, as it is the similarities between them that count. Evolution dictates that organisms will change through time, so it is only the features which persist that carry useful information about their origins.\\nMost people on either side of the debate do accept, however, that the ancient winged creature known as Archaeopteryx is an ancestor of today\u2019s birds. This is in spite of the fact that its form is distinctly non-bird-like, with a long bony tail, and teeth instead of a beak. The \u2018birds-are-dinosaurs\u2019 supporters contend that, if clearly-preserved feathers had not been found alongside two of the seven Archaeopteryx specimens, it would probably have been identified as a small dinosaur. However, Archaeopteryx does have some bird-like features, such as a furcula and bird-like feet, that suggest that it is too bird-like to be considered a dinosaur.\\nOver the last few decades several dinosaurs with bird-like features and primitive birds with dinosaur-like features have been found in several countries, connecting Archaeopteryx back to dinosaurs, and forwards to modern birds. Sinosauropteryx, excavated from 130-million-year-old rocks in northeast China, is one example. It is a dinosaur skeleton surrounded by a halo of fuzz, thought to be primitive feathers. And a reassessment of other dinosaurs reveals such bird-like features as hollow bones and a foot with three functional toes, characteristics that appeared over 50 million years before Archaeopteryx took to the air. And Rahonavis, a primitive bird from Madagascar is more bird-like than Archaeopteryx, yet retains some distinctive dinosaur features, including a long and vicious claw at the end of its wing. Over a century since Huxley\u2019s discovery, it seems that cladistics may have finally settled the \u2018dino-bird\u2019 debate.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"sentence_completion","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 5\\nComplete the sentences below.\\nChoose ONE WORD ONLY from the passage for each answer.\\nWrite your answers in boxes 1-5 on your answer sheet.\\n","questionTitle":"","questionContent":["1 Huxley formulated his theory while studying a dinosaur belonging to a group called \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 .","2 Heilmann rejected Huxley\u2019s theory because of the apparent absence of.................in dinosaurs.","3 Feduccia and Martin believe that the ancestor of today\u2019s birds was a kind of early \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 .","4 In cladistics, the ............... between organisms\u2019 characteristics are of major importance.","5 The dangerous................on a primitive bird from Madagascar adds weight to the \u2018dino-bird\u2019 argument."],"questions":[{"questionNumber":1,"correctAnswer":"theropods"},{"questionNumber":2,"correctAnswer":"collarbones"},{"questionNumber":3,"correctAnswer":"reptile"},{"questionNumber":4,"correctAnswer":"similarities"},{"questionNumber":5,"correctAnswer":"claw"}]}],"taskTime":600}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Summary Completion: selecting words from the text","taskSubtitle":"","passageContext":"[Note: This is an extract from a Part 3 text about the \u2018Plain English\u2019 movement, which promotes the use of clear English.]\u2018The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language\u2019, David Crystal, 3rd Edition, \xa9 Cambridge University Press, 2010.\\n","passageTitle":"","passageSubtitle":"","passageText":"The instructions accompanying do-it-yourself products are regularly cited as a source of unnecessary expense or frustration.

Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.\\n","passageTitle":"The Physics of Traffic Behavior","passageSubtitle":"","passageText":"A Some years ago, when several theoretical physicists, principally Dirk Helbing and Boris Kerner of Stuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in publications normally read by traffic engineers, they were clearly working outside their usual sphere of investigation. They had noticed that if they simulated the movement of vehicles on a highway, using the equations that describe how the molecules of a gas move, some very strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not behave exactly like gas molecules: for example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when they get too near another vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the physicists modified the equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of traffic as a flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic reproduces many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.\\nThe strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the implication that congestion can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary. Vehicles can be flowing freely along, at a density still well below what the road can handle, and then suddenly gel into a slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief and local fluctuation in the speed or the distance between vehicles is all it takes to trigger a system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. In fact, the physicists\u2019 analysis suggested such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably occur quite frequently on highways.\\nB Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to the phenomena popularized as \u2018chaos theory\u2019. This theory has arisen from the understanding that in any complex interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the others. Consequently, tiny variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge but unpredictable ways. This type of dramatic change from one state to another is similar to what happens when a chemical substance changes from a vapor to a liquid. It often happens that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after its temperature and density have reached the point where it could condense into water droplets. However, if the vapor encounters a solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, condensation can take place and the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and Kerner see traffic as a complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic density can act as the \u2018speck of dust\u2019 causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to synchronized traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the same speed, making passing impossible.\\nC The physicists have challenged proposals to set a maximum capacity for vehicles on highways. They argue that it may not be enough simply to limit the rate at which vehicles are allowed to enter a highway, rather, it may be necessary to time each vehicle\u2019s entry onto a highway precisely to coincide with a temporary drop in the density of vehicles along the road. The aim of doing this would be to smooth out any possible fluctuations in the road conditions that can trigger a change in traffic behavior and result in congestion. They further suggest that preventing breakdowns in the flow of traffic could ultimately require implementing the radical idea that has been suggested from time to time: directly regulating the speed and spacing of individual cars along a highway with central computers and sensors that communicate with each car\u2019s engine and brake controls.\\nD However, research into traffic control is generally centered in civil engineering departments and here the theories of the physicists have been greeted with some skepticism. Civil engineers favor a practical approach to problems and believe traffic congestion is the result of poor road construction (two lanes becoming one lane or dangerous curves), which constricts the flow of traffic. Engineers questioned how well the physicists\u2019 theoretical results relate to traffic in the real world. Indeed, some engineering researchers questioned whether elaborate chaos-theory interpretations are needed at all, since at least some of the traffic phenomena the physicists\u2019 theories predicted seemed to be similar to observations that had been appearing in traffic engineering literature under other names for years; observations which had straightforward cause-and-effect explanations.\\nE James Banks, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at San Diego State University in the US, suggested that a sudden slowdown in traffic may have less to do with chaos theory than with driver psychology. As traffic gets heavier and the passing lane gets more crowded, aggressive drivers move to other lanes to try to pass, which also tends to even out the speed between lanes. He also felt that another leveling force is that when a driver in a fast lane brakes a little to maintain a safe distance between vehicles, the shock wave travels back much more rapidly than it would in the other slower lanes, because each following driver has to react more quickly. Consequently, as a road becomes congested, the faster moving traffic is the first to slow down.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"matching_headings","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 4\\nReading Passage 1 has five sections, A-E.\\nChoose the correct heading for each section from the list of headings below.\\nWrite the correct number, i-viii, in boxes 1-4 on your answer sheet.\\n","tableTitle":"List of Headings","tableData":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"exampleAnswer":["Section B","i"],"questions":[{"questionNumber":1,"questionText":"Section A","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"]},{"questionNumber":2,"questionText":"Section C","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]},{"questionNumber":3,"questionText":"Section D","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"]},{"questionNumber":4,"questionText":"Section E","questionOptions":[["i","Dramatic effects can result from small changes in traffic just as in nature"],["ii","How a maths experiment actually reduced traffic congestion"],["iii","How a concept from one field of study was applied in another"],["iv","A lack of investment in driver training"],["v","Areas of doubt and disagreement between experts"],["vi","How different countries have dealt with traffic congestion"],["vii","The impact of driver behaviour on traffic speed"],["viii","A proposal to take control away from the driver"]],"correctAnswer":["vii","The impact of driver behavior on traffic speed"]}]}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Matching Features","taskSubtitle":"","taskTime":600,"passageContext":"[Note: This is an extract from an Academic Reading passage on the development of rockets.

It is probable that, some time in the tenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients of saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used to propel rockets. By the thirteenth century, powder-propelled fire arrows had become rather common. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to produce incendiary projectiles of many sorts, explosive grenades and possibly cannons to repel their enemies. One such weapon was the \'basket of fire\' or, as directly translated from Chinese, the \'arrows like flying leopards\'. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, each with a long tube of gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired from a long, octagonal-shaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. Another weapon was the \'arrow as a flying sabre\', which could be fired from crossbows. The rocket, placed in a similar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to increase the range. A small iron weight was attached to the 1.5m bamboo shaft, just below the feathers, to increase the arrow\'s stability by moving the centre of gravity to a position below the rocket. At a similar time, the Arabs had developed the \'egg which moves and burns\'. This \'egg\' was apparently full of gunpowder and stabilised by a 1.5m tail. It was fired using two rockets attached to either side of this tail.\\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that Europe became seriously interested in the possibilities of using the rocket itself as a weapon of war and not just to propel other weapons. Prior to this, rockets were used only in pyrotechnic displays. The incentive for the more aggressive use of rockets came not from within the European continent but from far-away India, whose leaders had built up a corps of rocketeers and used rockets successfully against the British in the late eighteenth century. The Indian rockets used against the British were described by a British Captain serving in India as \u2018an iron envelope about 200 millimetres long and 40 millimetres in diameter with sharp points at the top and a 3m-long bamboo guiding stick\u2019. In the early nineteenth century the British began to experiment with incendiary barrage rockets. The British rocket differed from the Indian version in that it was completely encased in a stout, iron cylinder, terminating in a conical head, measuring one metre in diameter and having a stick almost five metres long and constructed in such a way that it could be firmly attached to the body of the rocket. The Americans developed a rocket, complete with its own launcher, to use against the Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century. A long cylindrical tube was propped up by two sticks and fastened to the top of the launcher, thereby allowing the rockets to be inserted and lit from the other end. However, the results were sometimes not that impressive as the behaviour of the rockets in flight was less than predictable.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"matching_features","taskDescription":"Questions 7 \u2013 10\\nLook at the following items (Questions 7-10) and the list of groups below. \\nMatch each item with the group which first invented or used them.\\nWrite the correct letter A-E in boxes 7-10 on your answer sheet.\\nNB You may use any letter more than once.\\n","tableTitle":"First invented or used by","tableData":[["A","the Chinese"],["B","the Indians"],["C","the British"],["D","the Arabs"],["E","the Americans"]],"exampleAnswer":"","questions":[{"questionNumber":7,"questionText":"black powder","questionOptions":[["A","the Chinese"],["B","the Indians"],["C","the British"],["D","the Arabs"],["E","the Americans"]],"correctAnswer":["A"]},{"questionNumber":8,"questionText":"rocket-propelled arrows for fighting","questionOptions":[["A","the Chinese"],["B","the Indians"],["C","the British"],["D","the Arabs"],["E","the Americans"]],"correctAnswer":["A"]},{"questionNumber":9,"questionText":"rockets as war weapons","questionOptions":[["A","the Chinese"],["B","the Indians"],["C","the British"],["D","the Arabs"],["E","the Americans"]],"correctAnswer":["B"]},{"questionNumber":10,"questionText":"the rocket launcher","questionOptions":[["A","the Chinese"],["B","the Indians"],["C","the British"],["D","the Arabs"],["E","the Americans"]],"correctAnswer":["E"]}]}]}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"taskTitle":"Academic Reading Sample Task \u2013 Matching Sentence Endings","taskSubtitle":"","passageContext":"[Note: This is an extract from a Part 3 text about the scientific community in London in the 1500s.]","passageTitle":"Science in 16th-century London","passageSubtitle":"The Jewel House, a new book by historical researcher and author Deborah Harkness","passageText":"Deborah Harkness devotes her elegant and erudite new book, The Jewel House, to the scientific community in 16th-century London. She (rightly) argues that it is thanks to the imaginative collective efforts of the urbanscientists that London became the melting pot in which a new mathematical and experimental culture crystallized.\\nHarkness is known for her ingenuity as a researcher and her historical empathy. In The Jewel House, Harkness turns her skills on the city of London as a whole with surprising and fascinating results. She began her research by asking herself a new question: not what caused scientific revolution but what the names science and scientist meant in 16th-century London. Then she collected a vast range of sources, from printed books toscientific instruments and notebooks, and recorded, in a relational database, information on the men and women who produced them.\\nEvery chapter of The Jewel House charts the activities of a particular community. Harkness leads us through the streets of London, showing us, neighborhood by neighborhood, where the major forms of natural knowledge found homes. For example, apothecaries settled in Lime Street, in what is now the City, where they created a dense network of shops and gardens. Clockmakers, both nativecraftsmen and many from overseas,clustered in several parishes near St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The once wealthy merchant, Clement Draper, even managed to transform the King\u2019s Bench prison in Southwark, where he served time as a debtor, into a center of research and discussion. By the end of the book Harkness has mapped London\u2019s scientific communities with astonishing precision.\\nMoreover, when Harkness reconstructs these groups, she provides not traditional, static accounts of their theories, butdynamic analyses of their practices as these developed over time. In many cases, she makes clear, the alchemists of Elizabethan London already understood that knowledge of nature had to rest not on authority but on familiarity through practice.\\nIn one crucial respect, Harkness argues, many of the 16th-century London scientists differed from the later ones of the 17th century. They saw themselves less as individuals out to gain fame, than as members of larger textual communities bent on exchanging and compiling information. The passages in which Harkness analyzes the 16th- century practices of note-taking and communication are among the most novel and informative in this fine book. She shows that they adopted the textual information processing methods of humanist scholarship to radically new ends.\\nIn this book, Harkness has charted the local and cosmopolitan worlds of science in Elizabethan London with a learning, precision and intelligence that compel admiration. Moreover, she has crafted a complex and effective new analytical mechanism which may transform the practices of historians of early modern science.\\n","questionsList":[{"questionType":"matching_sentence_endings","taskDescription":"Questions 1 \u2013 3\\nComplete each sentence with the correct ending, A-F, below.
