    "passageMainText": "Of all mankind\u2019s manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions \u2013 the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread \u2013 may have transformed our material existence, but the advent of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other inventions pale in significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on language and originates from it. Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled power overall other animals, and even over nature itself.\nBut language is foremost not just because it came first. In its own right it is a tool of extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: \u2018this marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of expressions which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul\u2019. This was how, in 1660, the renowned French grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled the essence of language, and no one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude of its achievement. Even so, there is just one flaw in all these hymns of praise, for the homage to language\u2019s unique accomplishment conceals a simple yet critical incongruity. Language is mankind\u2019s greatest invention \u2013 except, of course, that it was never invented. This apparent paradox is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets",
