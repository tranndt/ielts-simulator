    "58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services \n",

       " 'raw_passage_text': \"The invention of rockets is linked inextricably with the invention of 'black powder'. Most \\nhistorians of technology credit the Chinese with its discovery. They base their belief on \\nstudies of Chinese writings or on the notebooks of early Europeans who settled in or \\nmade long visits to China to study its history and civilisation. It is probable that, some \\ntime in the tenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients \\nof saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used \\nto propel rockets. By the thirteenth century, powder-propelled fire arrows had become \\nrather common. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to \\nproduce incendiary projectiles of many sorts, explosive grenades and possibly cannons \\nto repel their enemies. One such weapon was the 'basket of fire' or, as directly \\ntranslated from Chinese, the 'arrows like flying leopards'. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, \\neach with a long tube of gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired \\nfrom a long, octagonal-shaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. \\nAnother weapon was the 'arrow as a flying sabre', which could be fired from crossbows. \\nThe rocket, placed in a similar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to \\nincrease the range. A small iron weight was attached to the 1.5m bamboo shaft, just \\nbelow the feathers, to increase the arrow's stability by moving the centre of gravity to a \\nposition below the rocket. At a similar time, the Arabs had developed the 'egg which \\nmoves and burns'. This 'egg' was apparently full of gunpowder and stabilised by a 1.5m \\ntail. It was fired using two rockets attached to either side of this tail.\\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that Europe became seriously interested in the \\npossibilities of using the rocket itself as a weapon of war and not just to propel other \\nweapons. Prior to this, rockets were used only in pyrotechnic displays. The incentive for \\nthe more aggressive use of rockets came not from within the European continent but \\nfrom far-away India, whose leaders had built up a corps of rocketeers and used rockets \\nsuccessfully against the British in the late eighteenth century. The Indian rockets used \\nagainst the British were described by a British Captain serving in India as ‘an iron \\nenvelope about 200 millimetres long and 40 millimetres in diameter with sharp points at \\nthe top and a 3m-long bamboo guiding stick’. In the early nineteenth century the British \\nbegan to experiment with incendiary barrage rockets. The British rocket differed from the \\nIndian version in that it was completely encased in a stout, iron cylinder, terminating in a \\nconical head, measuring one metre in diameter and having a stick almost five metres \\nlong and constructed in such a way that it could be firmly attached to the body of the \\nrocket. The Americans developed a rocket, complete with its own launcher, to use \\nagainst the Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century. A long cylindrical tube was propped \\nup by two sticks and fastened to the top of the launcher, thereby allowing the rockets to \\nbe inserted and lit from the other end. However, the results were sometimes not that \\nimpressive as the behaviour of the rockets in flight was less than predictable.\\n\",\n",

       " 'raw_passage_text': 'The marriage of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to \\nachieve results of world significance. Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery in 1896 of a new \\nphenomenon, which Marie later called ‘radioactivity’, Marie Curie decided to find out if the \\nradioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this \\nwas true for thorium.\\nTurning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose \\nradioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore \\nof small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the \\nwork that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and that led to the discovery of the new \\nelements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study \\nof the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was \\nachieved with the help of the chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie’s pupils. Based \\non the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie \\nand Pierre shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.\\nThe births of Marie’s two daughters, Irène and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her \\nscientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in \\nSèvres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on experimental \\ndemonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by \\nPierre Curie.\\nThe sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning \\npoint in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific \\nwork that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had \\nbeen left vacant on her husband’s death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In \\n1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the isolation of a pure form of radium.\\nDuring World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irène, devoted herself to the \\ndevelopment of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as \\n‘Little Curies’, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose \\nstaff Irène had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a centre for nuclear physics and \\nchemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922, a member of the \\nAcademy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical \\napplications.\\nIn 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United \\nStates to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for \\nher campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in \\naddition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the Curie Foundation in Paris, and the \\ninauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia became director.\\nOne of Marie Curie’s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate \\nintense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for \\nresearch. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5 grams of radium made a \\ndecisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in the years around 1930. This \\nwork prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for \\nthe discovery in 1934 by Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie of artificial radioactivity. A few months \\nafter this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. \\nShe had often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the \\npretty blue-green light they gave off.\\nHer contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work, the importance of which \\nhad been demonstrated by her two Nobel Prizes, but because of her influence on subsequent \\ngenerations of nuclear physicists and chemists.\\n',\n",

      " \"passageText\": \"The marriage of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to achieve results of world significance. Following Henri Becquerel\\u2019s discovery in 1896 of a new phenomenon, which Marie later called \\u2018radioactivity\\u2019, Marie Curie decided to find out if the radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this was true for thorium.\\nTurning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and that led to the discovery of the new elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was achieved with the help of the chemist Andr\\u00e9-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie\\u2019s pupils. Based on the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie and Pierre shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.\\nThe births of Marie\\u2019s two daughters, Ir\\u00e8ne and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her scientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the \\u00c9cole Normale Sup\\u00e9rieure for girls in S\\u00e8vres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on experimental demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by Pierre Curie.\\nThe sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning point in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific work that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had been left vacant on her husband\\u2019s death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the isolation of a pure form of radium.\\nDuring World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Ir\\u00e8ne, devoted herself to the development of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as \\u2018Little Curies\\u2019, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose staff Ir\\u00e8ne had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a centre for nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922, a member of the Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical applications.\\nIn 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United States to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for her campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the Curie Foundation in Paris, and the inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia became director.\\nOne of Marie Curie\\u2019s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for research. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5 grams of radium made a decisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in the years around 1930. This work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for the discovery in 1934 by Ir\\u00e8ne and Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie of artificial radioactivity. A few months after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. She had often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the pretty blue-green light they gave off.\\nHer contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work, the importance of which had been demonstrated by her two Nobel Prizes, but because of her influence on subsequent generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.\\n\",\n",

       " 'raw_passage_text': 'The science of evolutionary relationships has undergone a major change in recent decades. It used \\nto be the case that all the features of organisms were important in working out their family tree. \\nBut following the work of German entomologist Willi Hennig, many evolutionary scientists now \\nbelieve that the only features which carry any useful information are the evolutionary ‘novelties’ \\nshared between organisms. Mice, lizards and fish, for example, all have backbones – so the feature \\n‘backbone’ tells us nothing about their evolutionary relationship. But the feature ‘four legs’ is \\nuseful because it’s an evolutionary novelty – a characteristic shared only between the lizard and \\nthe mouse. This would suggest that the lizard and mouse are more closely related to each other \\nthan either is to the fish. This revolutionary approach is called cladistics, and it has been central to \\nthe idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs.\\nThe ‘birds are dinosaurs’ theory was first developed by English palaeontologist Thomas Huxley \\n(1825–1895). According to some accounts, one evening Huxley went to dinner still thinking about \\na mystery dinosaur bone in his lab. He knew he was dealing with the lower leg bone (tibia) of a \\nmeat-eating, two-legged dinosaur belonging to the classification known as theropods, but attached \\nto the tibia was an unidentified extra bone. On the menu that evening was quail, a small bird \\nsimilar to a pheasant, and Huxley noticed the same strange bone, attached to the quail tibia on his \\nplate. He later realised that it was in fact the bird’s anklebone. More importantly, Huxley \\nconcluded that its forms in both dinosaur and bird skeletons were so similar that they must be \\nclosely related.\\nHuxley’s idea fell out of favour for fifty years following the 1916 publication of The Origin of \\nBirds by the Danish doctor Gerhard Heilmann. During this time, Heilmann’s theory was widely \\naccepted. Heilmann had noted that two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs lacked collarbones. In later \\nevolutionary stages these bones fuse together to form the distinctive ‘Y’- shaped bone in a bird’s \\nneck, known as the furcula. Heilmann proposed the notion that such a feature could not be lost and \\nthen re-evolve at a later date, so dinosaurs could not be the ancestors of birds.\\nThen, in the late 1960s, John Ostrom from Yale University in the US, noted 22 features in the \\nskeletons of meat-eating dinosaurs that were also found in birds and nowhere else. This reset the \\nthinking on bird ancestry and once again Huxley’s ideas caught the attention of the scientific \\ncommunity. Subsequent work has found up to 85 characteristics that tie dinosaurs and birds \\ntogether. But what of Heilmann’s missing bones? It turns out that not only did many dinosaurs \\nhave collarbones, these were also fused together into a furcula. Unfortunately for Heilmann, the \\nfossil evidence was somewhat lacking in his day, and the few furculae that had been found were \\nmisidentified, usually as belly ribs\\nUS ornithologist Alan Feduccia and palaeontologist Larry Martin are two vocal opponents of the \\ndinosaur theory. They contend that birds evolved from some unknown reptile at a time long before \\ndinosaurs. Their reasoning is that flight is most likely to have started from a tree-climbing \\nancestor, yet all the proposed dinosaurian ancestors were ground-dwellers. But the dino-bird \\nsupporters contend that an unknown dinosaurian bird-ancestor could have been tree-dwelling, or \\nthat birds evolved flight from the ground up by chasing and leaping after insects. Most of \\nFeduccia and Martin’s case against the ‘birds-are-dinosaurs’ hypothesis is based on differences \\nbetween birds and dinosaurs. Supporters of cladistics, however, maintain that differences between \\norganisms do not matter, as it is the similarities between them that count. Evolution dictates that \\norganisms will change through time, so it is only the features which persist that carry useful \\ninformation about their origins.\\nMost people on either side of the debate do accept, however, that the ancient winged creature \\nknown as Archaeopteryx is an ancestor of today’s birds. This is in spite of the fact that its form is \\ndistinctly non-bird-like, with a long bony tail, and teeth instead of a beak. The ‘birds-are-dinosaurs’ supporters contend that, if clearly-preserved feathers had not been found alongside two \\nof the seven Archaeopteryx specimens, it would probably have been identified as a small dinosaur. \\nHowever, Archaeopteryx does have some bird-like features, such as a furcula and bird-like feet, \\nthat suggest that it is too bird-like to be considered a dinosaur.\\nOver the last few decades several dinosaurs with bird-like features and primitive birds with \\ndinosaur-like features have been found in several countries, connecting Archaeopteryx back to \\ndinosaurs, and forwards to modern birds. Sinosauropteryx, excavated from 130-million-year-old \\nrocks in northeast China, is one example. It is a dinosaur skeleton surrounded by a halo of fuzz, \\nthought to be primitive feathers. And a reassessment of other dinosaurs reveals such bird-like \\nfeatures as hollow bones and a foot with three functional toes, characteristics that appeared over \\n50 million years before Archaeopteryx took to the air. And Rahonavis, a primitive bird from \\nMadagascar is more bird-like than Archaeopteryx, yet retains some distinctive dinosaur features, \\nincluding a long and vicious claw at the end of its wing. Over a century since Huxley’s discovery, \\nit seems that cladistics may have finally settled the ‘dino-bird’ debate.\\n',\n",

Sinosauropteryx, excavated from 130-million-year-old rocks in northeast China, is one example. It is a dinosaur skeleton surrounded by a halo of fuzz, thought to be primitive feathers. And a reassessment of other dinosaurs reveals such bird-like features as hollow bones and a foot with three functional toes, characteristics that appeared over 50 million years before Archaeopteryx took to the air. And Rahonavis, a primitive bird from Madagascar is more bird-like than Archaeopteryx, yet retains some distinctive dinosaur features, including a long and vicious claw at the end of its wing. Over a century since Huxley\\u2019s discovery, it seems that cladistics may have finally settled the \\u2018dino-bird\\u2019 debate.\\n\",\n",
