    "they persuade a 55-year old to take early retirement. Take away seniority-based pay scales, and \n",

    "although manual workers on piece-rates often earn less as they get older. So retaining the \n",

    "\n",
    "One innovation was devised by IBM Belgium. Faced with the need to cut staff costs, and having \n",
    "decided to concentrate cuts on 55 to 60-year olds, IBM set up a separate company called Skill \n",
    "Team, which re-employed any of the early retired who wanted to go on working up to the age of \n",
    "60. An employee who joined Skill Team at the age of 55 on a five-year contract would work for \n",
    "58% of his time, over the full period, for 88% of his last IBM salary. The company offered services \n",

       " 'raw_passage_text': \"The invention of rockets is linked inextricably with the invention of 'black powder'. Most \\nhistorians of technology credit the Chinese with its discovery. They base their belief on \\nstudies of Chinese writings or on the notebooks of early Europeans who settled in or \\nmade long visits to China to study its history and civilisation. It is probable that, some \\ntime in the tenth century, black powder was first compounded from its basic ingredients \\nof saltpetre, charcoal and sulphur. But this does not mean that it was immediately used \\nto propel rockets. By the thirteenth century, powder-propelled fire arrows had become \\nrather common. The Chinese relied on this type of technological development to \\nproduce incendiary projectiles of many sorts, explosive grenades and possibly cannons \\nto repel their enemies. One such weapon was the 'basket of fire' or, as directly \\ntranslated from Chinese, the 'arrows like flying leopards'. The 0.7 metre-long arrows, \\neach with a long tube of gunpowder attached near the point of each arrow, could be fired \\nfrom a long, octagonal-shaped basket at the same time and had a range of 400 paces. \\nAnother weapon was the 'arrow as a flying sabre', which could be fired from crossbows. \\nThe rocket, placed in a similar position to other rocket-propelled arrows, was designed to \\nincrease the range. A small iron weight was attached to the 1.5m bamboo shaft, just \\nbelow the feathers, to increase the arrow's stability by moving the centre of gravity to a \\nposition below the rocket. At a similar time, the Arabs had developed the 'egg which \\nmoves and burns'. This 'egg' was apparently full of gunpowder and stabilised by a 1.5m \\ntail. It was fired using two rockets attached to either side of this tail.\\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that Europe became seriously interested in the \\npossibilities of using the rocket itself as a weapon of war and not just to propel other \\nweapons. Prior to this, rockets were used only in pyrotechnic displays. The incentive for \\nthe more aggressive use of rockets came not from within the European continent but \\nfrom far-away India, whose leaders had built up a corps of rocketeers and used rockets \\nsuccessfully against the British in the late eighteenth century. The Indian rockets used \\nagainst the British were described by a British Captain serving in India as ‘an iron \\nenvelope about 200 millimetres long and 40 millimetres in diameter with sharp points at \\nthe top and a 3m-long bamboo guiding stick’. In the early nineteenth century the British \\nbegan to experiment with incendiary barrage rockets. The British rocket differed from the \\nIndian version in that it was completely encased in a stout, iron cylinder, terminating in a \\nconical head, measuring one metre in diameter and having a stick almost five metres \\nlong and constructed in such a way that it could be firmly attached to the body of the \\nrocket. The Americans developed a rocket, complete with its own launcher, to use \\nagainst the Mexicans in the mid-nineteenth century. A long cylindrical tube was propped \\nup by two sticks and fastened to the top of the launcher, thereby allowing the rockets to \\nbe inserted and lit from the other end. However, the results were sometimes not that \\nimpressive as the behaviour of the rockets in flight was less than predictable.\\n\",\n",

In The \\nJewel House, Harkness turns her skills on the \\ncity of London as a whole with surprising and \\nfascinating results. She began her research by \\nasking herself a new question: not what \\ncaused scientific revolution but what the \\nnames science and scientist meant in 16th-century London. Then she collected a vast \\nrange of sources, from printed books to\\nscientific instruments and notebooks, and \\nrecorded, in a relational database, information \\non the men and women who produced them.\\nEvery chapter of The Jewel House charts the \\nactivities of a particular community. Harkness \\nleads us through the streets of London, \\nshowing us, neighborhood by neighborhood, \\nwhere the major forms of natural knowledge \\nfound homes. For example, apothecaries \\nsettled in Lime Street, in what is now the City, \\nwhere they created a dense network of shops \\nand gardens. Clockmakers, both native\\ncraftsmen and many from overseas,\\nclustered in several parishes near St Paul’s \\nCathedral. The once wealthy merchant, \\nClement Draper, even managed to transform \\nthe King’s Bench prison in Southwark, where \\nhe served time as a debtor, into a center of \\nresearch and discussion. By the end of the \\nbook Harkness has mapped London’s \\nscientific communities with astonishing \\nprecision.\\nMoreover, when Harkness reconstructs \\nthese groups, she provides not traditional, \\nstatic accounts of their theories, but\\ndynamic analyses of their practices as \\nthese developed over time. In many cases, \\nshe makes clear, the alchemists of \\nElizabethan London already understood \\nthat knowledge of nature had to rest not on \\nauthority but on familiarity through practice.\\nIn one crucial respect, Harkness argues, \\nmany of the 16th-century London scientists \\ndiffered from the later ones of the 17th \\ncentury. They saw themselves less as \\nindividuals out to gain fame, than as \\nmembers of larger textual communities bent \\non exchanging and compiling information. \\nThe passages in which Harkness analyzes the \\n16th- century practices of note-taking and \\ncommunication are among the most novel \\nand informative in this fine book. She shows \\nthat they adopted the textual information \\nprocessing methods of humanist scholarship \\nto radically new ends.\\nPage 20 of 46 IELTS.org\\nIn this book, Harkness has charted the local \\nand cosmopolitan worlds of science in \\nElizabethan London with a learning, precision \\nand intelligence that compel admiration. \\nMoreover, she has crafted a complex and \\neffective new analytical mechanism which \\nmay transform the practices of historians of \\nearly modern science.\\n',\n",
