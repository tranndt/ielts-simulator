After this remote Pacific island was settled by the Polynesians, it remained isolated for centuries. All the energy and resources that went into the moai \u2013 some of which are ten metres tall and weigh over 7,000 kilos \u2013 came from the island itself. Yet when Dutch explorers landed in 1722, they met a Stone Age culture. The moai were carved with stone tools, then transported for many kilometres, without the use of animals or wheels, to massive stone platforms. The identity of the moai builders was in doubt until well into the twentieth century. Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer, thought the statues had been created by pre-Inca peoples from Peru. Bestselling Swiss author Erich von Daniken believed they were built by stranded extraterrestrials. Modern science \u2013 linguistic, archaeological and genetic evidence \u2013 has definitively proved the moai builders were Polynesians, but not how they moved their creations. Local folklore maintains that the statues walked, while researchers have tended to assume the ancestors dragged the statues somehow, using ropes and logs.\nB\nWhen the Europeans arrived, Rapa Nui was grassland, with only a few scrawny trees. In the 1970s and 1980s, though, researchers found pollen preserved in lake sediments, which proved the island had been covered in lush palm forests for thousands of years. Only after the Polynesians arrived did those forests disappear. US scientist Jared Diamond believes that the Rapanui people \u2013 descendants of Polynesian settlers \u2013 wrecked their own environment. They had unfortunately settled on an extremely fragile island \u2013 dry, cool, and too remote to be properly fertilised by windblown volcanic ash. When the islanders cleared the forests for firewood and farming, the forests didn\u2019t grow back. As trees became scarce and they could no longer construct wooden canoes for fishing, they ate birds. Soil erosion decreased their crop yields. Before Europeans arrived, the Rapanui had descended into civil war and cannibalism, he maintains. The collapse of their isolated civilisation, Diamond writes, is a \u2019worst-case scenario for what may lie ahead of us in our own future\u2019.\nC\nThe moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction. Diamond interprets them as power displays by rival chieftains who, trapped on a remote little island, lacked other ways of asserting their dominance. They competed by building ever bigger figures. Diamond thinks they laid the moai on wooden sledges, hauled over log rails, but that required both a lot of wood and a lot of people. To feed the people, even more land had to be cleared. When the wood was gone and civil war began, the islanders began toppling the moai. By the nineteenth century none were standing.\nD\nArchaeologists Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii and Carl Lipo of California State University agree that Easter Island lost its lush forests and that it was an \u2018ecological catastrophe\u2019 \u2013 but they believe the islanders themselves weren\u2019t to blame. And the moai certainly weren\u2019t. Archaeological excavations indicate that the Rapanui went to heroic efforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile fields. They built thousands of circular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them, and used broken volcanic rocks to keep the soil moist. In short, Hunt and Lipo argue, the prehistoric Rapanui were pioneers of sustainable farming.\nE\nHunt and Lipo contend that moai-building was an activity that helped keep the peace between islanders. They also believe that moving the moai required few people and no wood, because they were walked upright. On that issue, Hunt and Lipo say, archaeological evidence backs up Rapanui folklore. Recent experiments indicate that as few as 18 people could, with three strong ropes and a bit of practice, easily manoeuvre a 1,000 kg moai replica a few hundred metres. The figures\u2019 fat bellies tilted them forward, and a D-shaped base allowed handlers to roll and rock them side to side.\nF\nMoreover, Hunt and Lipo are convinced that the settlers were not wholly responsible for the loss of the island\u2019s trees. Archaeological finds of nuts from the extinct Easter Island palm show tiny grooves, made by the teeth of Polynesian rats. The rats arrived along with the settlers, and in just a few years, Hunt and Lipo calculate, they would have overrun the island. They would have prevented the reseeding of the slow-growing palm trees and thereby doomed Rapa Nui\u2019s forest, even without the settlers\u2019 campaign of deforestation. No doubt the rats ate birds\u2019 eggs too. Hunt and Lipo also see no evidence that Rapanui civilisation collapsed when the palm forest did. They think its population grew rapidly and then remained more or less stable until the arrival of the Europeans, who introduced deadly diseases to which islanders had no immunity. Then in the nineteenth century slave traders decimated the population, which shrivelled to 111 people by 1877.\nG\nHunt and Lipo\u2019s vision, therefore, is one of an island populated by peaceful and ingenious moai builders and careful stewards of the land, rather than by reckless destroyers ruining their own environment and society. \u2018Rather than a case of abject failure, Rapu Nui is an unlikely story of success\u2019, they claim.

When the islanders were no longer able to build the 22\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 they needed to go fishing, they began using the island\u2019s 23\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. as a food source, according to Diamond. Diamond also claims that the moai were built to show the power of the island\u2019s chieftains, and that the methods of transporting the statues needed not only a great number of people, but also a great deal of 24\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.",
