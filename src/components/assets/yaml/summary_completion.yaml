    The instructions accompanying do-it-yourself products are regularly cited as a source 
    of unnecessary expense or frustration. Few companies seem to test their instructions

    steps in the construction process are taken for granted, and some degree of special 
    knowledge is assumed. This is especially worrying in any fields where failure to
