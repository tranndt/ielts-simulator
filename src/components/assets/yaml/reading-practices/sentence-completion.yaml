    The origins of birds


  passage_subtitle: |


  passage_main_text: |
    The science of evolutionary relationships has undergone a major change in recent decades. It used 
    to be the case that all the features of organisms were important in working out their family tree. 
    But following the work of German entomologist Willi Hennig, many evolutionary scientists now 
    believe that the only features which carry any useful information are the evolutionary ‘novelties’ 
    shared between organisms. Mice, lizards and fish, for example, all have backbones – so the feature 
    ‘backbone’ tells us nothing about their evolutionary relationship. But the feature ‘four legs’ is 
    useful because it’s an evolutionary novelty – a characteristic shared only between the lizard and 
    the mouse. This would suggest that the lizard and mouse are more closely related to each other 
    than either is to the fish. This revolutionary approach is called cladistics, and it has been central to 
    the idea that birds evolved from dinosaurs.
    The ‘birds are dinosaurs’ theory was first developed by English palaeontologist Thomas Huxley 
    (1825–1895). According to some accounts, one evening Huxley went to dinner still thinking about 
    a mystery dinosaur bone in his lab. He knew he was dealing with the lower leg bone (tibia) of a 
    meat-eating, two-legged dinosaur belonging to the classification known as theropods, but attached 
    to the tibia was an unidentified extra bone. On the menu that evening was quail, a small bird 
    similar to a pheasant, and Huxley noticed the same strange bone, attached to the quail tibia on his 
    plate. He later realised that it was in fact the bird’s anklebone. More importantly, Huxley 
    concluded that its forms in both dinosaur and bird skeletons were so similar that they must be 
    closely related.
    Huxley’s idea fell out of favour for fifty years following the 1916 publication of The Origin of 
    Birds by the Danish doctor Gerhard Heilmann. During this time, Heilmann’s theory was widely 
    accepted. Heilmann had noted that two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs lacked collarbones. In later 
    evolutionary stages these bones fuse together to form the distinctive ‘Y’- shaped bone in a bird’s 
    neck, known as the furcula. Heilmann proposed the notion that such a feature could not be lost and 
    then re-evolve at a later date, so dinosaurs could not be the ancestors of birds.
    Then, in the late 1960s, John Ostrom from Yale University in the US, noted 22 features in the 
    skeletons of meat-eating dinosaurs that were also found in birds and nowhere else. This reset the 
    thinking on bird ancestry and once again Huxley’s ideas caught the attention of the scientific 
    community. Subsequent work has found up to 85 characteristics that tie dinosaurs and birds 
    together. But what of Heilmann’s missing bones? It turns out that not only did many dinosaurs 
    have collarbones, these were also fused together into a furcula. Unfortunately for Heilmann, the 
    fossil evidence was somewhat lacking in his day, and the few furculae that had been found were 
    misidentified, usually as belly ribs
    US ornithologist Alan Feduccia and palaeontologist Larry Martin are two vocal opponents of the 
    dinosaur theory. They contend that birds evolved from some unknown reptile at a time long before 
    dinosaurs. Their reasoning is that flight is most likely to have started from a tree-climbing 
    ancestor, yet all the proposed dinosaurian ancestors were ground-dwellers. But the dino-bird 
    supporters contend that an unknown dinosaurian bird-ancestor could have been tree-dwelling, or 
    that birds evolved flight from the ground up by chasing and leaping after insects. Most of 
    Feduccia and Martin’s case against the ‘birds-are-dinosaurs’ hypothesis is based on differences 
    between birds and dinosaurs. Supporters of cladistics, however, maintain that differences between 
    organisms do not matter, as it is the similarities between them that count. Evolution dictates that 
    organisms will change through time, so it is only the features which persist that carry useful 
    information about their origins.
    Most people on either side of the debate do accept, however, that the ancient winged creature 
    known as Archaeopteryx is an ancestor of today’s birds. This is in spite of the fact that its form is 
    distinctly non-bird-like, with a long bony tail, and teeth instead of a beak. The ‘birds-are-dinosaurs’ supporters contend that, if clearly-preserved feathers had not been found alongside two 
    of the seven Archaeopteryx specimens, it would probably have been identified as a small dinosaur. 
    However, Archaeopteryx does have some bird-like features, such as a furcula and bird-like feet, 
    that suggest that it is too bird-like to be considered a dinosaur.
    Over the last few decades several dinosaurs with bird-like features and primitive birds with 
    dinosaur-like features have been found in several countries, connecting Archaeopteryx back to 
    dinosaurs, and forwards to modern birds. Sinosauropteryx, excavated from 130-million-year-old 
    rocks in northeast China, is one example. It is a dinosaur skeleton surrounded by a halo of fuzz, 
    thought to be primitive feathers. And a reassessment of other dinosaurs reveals such bird-like 
    features as hollow bones and a foot with three functional toes, characteristics that appeared over 
    50 million years before Archaeopteryx took to the air. And Rahonavis, a primitive bird from 
    Madagascar is more bird-like than Archaeopteryx, yet retains some distinctive dinosaur features, 
    including a long and vicious claw at the end of its wing. Over a century since Huxley’s discovery, 
    it seems that cladistics may have finally settled the ‘dino-bird’ debate.
