    Clearly, when older people do heavy physical work, their age may affect their productivity. But 
    other skills may increase with age, including many that are crucial for good management, such as 
    an ability to handle people diplomatically, to run a meeting or to spot a problem before it blows 
    up. Peter Hicks, who co-ordinates OECD work on the policy implications of ageing, says that 
    plenty of research suggests older people are paid more because they are worth more.
    And the virtues of the young may be exaggerated. ‘The few companies that have kept on older 
    workers find they have good judgement and their productivity is good,’ says Peter Peterson, 
    author of a recent book on the impact of ageing. ‘Besides, their education standards are much 
    better than those of today’s young high-school graduates.’ Companies may say that older 
    workers are not worth training because they are reaching the end of their working lives; in fact, 
    young people tend to switch jobs so frequently that they offer the worst returns on training. The 
    median age for employer-driven training is the late 40s and early 50s, and this training goes 
    mainly to managers.
