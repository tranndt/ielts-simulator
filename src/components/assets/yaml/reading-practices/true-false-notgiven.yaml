  passage_title: |
    The life and work of Marie Curie


  passage_subtitle: |


  passage_main_text: |
    Marie Curie is probably the most famous woman scientist who has ever lived. Born Maria 
    Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she is famous for her work on radioactivity, and was twice a 
    winner of the Nobel Prize. With her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel, she was 
    awarded the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics, and was then sole winner of the 1911 Nobel Prize 
    for Chemistry. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
    From childhood, Marie was remarkable for her prodigious memory, and at the age of 16 won 
    a gold medal on completion of her secondary education. Because her father lost his savings 
    through bad investment, she then had to take work as a teacher. From her earnings she was 
    able to finance her sister Bronia’s medical studies in Paris, on the understanding that Bronia 
    would, in turn, later help her to get an education.
    In 1891 this promise was fulfilled and Marie went to Paris and began to study at the 
    Sorbonne (the University of Paris). She often worked far into the night and lived on little 
    more than bread and butter and tea. She came first in the examination in the physical 
    sciences in 1893, and in 1894 was placed second in the examination in mathematical 
    sciences. It was not until the spring of that year that she was introduced to Pierre Curie.
