  passage_main_text: |
    Of all mankind’s manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions – the 
    wheel, agriculture, sliced bread – may have transformed our material existence, but the advent 
    of language is what made us human. Compared to language, all other inventions pale in 
    significance, since everything we have ever achieved depends on language and originates from 
    it. Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled power over
    all other animals, and even over nature itself.
    But language is foremost not just because it came first. In its own right it is a tool of 
    extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of ingenious simplicity: ‘this marvellous 
    invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that infinite variety of expressions 
    which, whilst having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow us to disclose to 
    others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot penetrate it all that we 
    imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’. This was how, in 1660, the renowned French 
    grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles distilled the essence of language, and no 
    one since has celebrated more eloquently the magnitude of its achievement. Even so, there is 
    just one flaw in all these hymns of praise, for the homage to language’s unique accomplishment 
    conceals a simple yet critical incongruity. Language is mankind’s greatest invention – except, of 
    course, that it was never invented. This apparent paradox is at the core of our fascination with 
    language, and it holds many of its secrets
