    Science in 16th-century London

    The Jewel House, a new book by historical researcher and author 
    Deborah Harkness

raw_passage_text: |
    Deborah Harkness devotes her elegant 
    and erudite new book, The Jewel House, to the 
    scientific community in 16th-century London. 
    She (rightly) argues that it is thanks to the 
    imaginative collective efforts of the urban
    scientists that London became the melting pot 
    in which a new mathematical and 
    experimental culture crystallized.
    Harkness is known for her ingenuity as a 
    researcher and her historical empathy. In The 
    Jewel House, Harkness turns her skills on the 
    city of London as a whole with surprising and 
    fascinating results. She began her research by 
    asking herself a new question: not what 
    caused scientific revolution but what the 
    names science and scientist meant in 16th-century London. Then she collected a vast 
    range of sources, from printed books to
    scientific instruments and notebooks, and 
    recorded, in a relational database, information 
    on the men and women who produced them.
    Every chapter of The Jewel House charts the 
    activities of a particular community. Harkness 
    leads us through the streets of London, 
    showing us, neighborhood by neighborhood, 
    where the major forms of natural knowledge 
    found homes. For example, apothecaries 
    settled in Lime Street, in what is now the City, 
    where they created a dense network of shops 
    and gardens. Clockmakers, both native
    craftsmen and many from overseas,
    clustered in several parishes near St Paul’s 
    Cathedral. The once wealthy merchant, 
    Clement Draper, even managed to transform 
    the King’s Bench prison in Southwark, where 
    he served time as a debtor, into a center of 
    research and discussion. By the end of the 
    book Harkness has mapped London’s 
    scientific communities with astonishing 
    precision.
    Moreover, when Harkness reconstructs 
    these groups, she provides not traditional, 
    static accounts of their theories, but
    dynamic analyses of their practices as 
    these developed over time. In many cases, 
    she makes clear, the alchemists of 
    Elizabethan London already understood 
    that knowledge of nature had to rest not on 
    authority but on familiarity through practice.
    In one crucial respect, Harkness argues, 
    many of the 16th-century London scientists 
    differed from the later ones of the 17th 
    century. They saw themselves less as 
    individuals out to gain fame, than as 
    members of larger textual communities bent 
    on exchanging and compiling information. 
    The passages in which Harkness analyzes the 
    16th- century practices of note-taking and 
    communication are among the most novel 
    and informative in this fine book. She shows 
    that they adopted the textual information 
    processing methods of humanist scholarship 
    to radically new ends.
    In this book, Harkness has charted the local 
    and cosmopolitan worlds of science in 
    Elizabethan London with a learning, precision 
    and intelligence that compel admiration. 
    Moreover, she has crafted a complex and 
    effective new analytical mechanism which 
    may transform the practices of historians of 
    early modern science.
