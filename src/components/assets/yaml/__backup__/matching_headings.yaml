    The Physics of Traffic Behavior

    A 
    Some years ago, when several theoretical physicists, principally Dirk Helbing and Boris Kerner of 
    Stuttgart, Germany, began publishing papers on traffic flow in publications normally read by traffic 
    engineers, they were clearly working outside their usual sphere of investigation. They had noticed 
    that if they simulated the movement of vehicles on a highway, using the equations that describe 
    how the molecules of a gas move, some very strange results emerged. Of course, vehicles do not 
    behave exactly like gas molecules: for example, drivers try to avoid collisions by slowing down when 
    they get too near another vehicle, whereas gas molecules have no such concern. However, the 
    physicists modified the equations to take the differences into account and the overall description of 
    traffic as a flowing gas has proved to be a very good one; the moving-gas model of traffic 
    reproduces many phenomena seen in real-world traffic.
    The strangest thing that came out of these equations, however, was the implication that congestion 
    can arise completely spontaneously; no external causes are necessary. Vehicles can be flowing 
    freely along, at a density still well below what the road can handle, and then suddenly gel into a 
    slow-moving ooze. Under the right conditions a brief and local fluctuation in the speed or the 
    distance between vehicles is all it takes to trigger a system-wide breakdown that persists for hours. 
    In fact, the physicists’ analysis suggested such spontaneous breakdowns in traffic flow probably 
    occur quite frequently on highways.
    B
    Though a decidedly unsettling discovery, this showed striking similarities to the phenomena 
    popularized as ‘chaos theory’. This theory has arisen from the understanding that in any complex 
    interacting system which is made of many parts, each part affects the others. Consequently, tiny 
    variations in one part of a complex system can grow in huge but unpredictable ways. This type of 
    dramatic change from one state to another is similar to what happens when a chemical substance 
    changes from a vapor to a liquid. It often happens that water in a cloud remains as a gas even after 
    its temperature and density have reached the point where it could condense into water droplets. 
    However, if the vapor encounters a solid surface, even something as small as a speck of dust, 
    condensation can take place and the transition from vapor to liquid finally occurs. Helbing and 
    Kerner see traffic as a complex interacting system. They found that a small fluctuation in traffic 
    density can act as the ‘speck of dust’ causing a sudden change from freely moving traffic to 
    synchronized traffic, when vehicles in all lanes abruptly slow down and start moving at the same 
    speed, making passing impossible.
    C 
    The physicists have challenged proposals to set a maximum capacity for vehicles on highways. They 
    argue that it may not be enough simply to limit the rate at which vehicles are allowed to enter a 
    highway, rather, it may be necessary to time each vehicle’s entry onto a highway precisely to 
    coincide with a temporary drop in the density of vehicles along the road. The aim of doing this 
    would be to smooth out any possible fluctuations in the road conditions that can trigger a change in 
    traffic behavior and result in congestion. They further suggest that preventing breakdowns in the 
    flow of traffic could ultimately require implementing the radical idea that has been suggested from 
    time to time: directly regulating the speed and spacing of individual cars along a highway with 
    central computers and sensors that communicate with each car’s engine and brake controls.
    D 
    However, research into traffic control is generally centered in civil engineering departments and 
    here the theories of the physicists have been greeted with some skepticism. Civil engineers favor a 
    practical approach to problems and believe traffic congestion is the result of poor road construction 
    (two lanes becoming one lane or dangerous curves), which constricts the flow of traffic. Engineers 
    questioned how well the physicists’ theoretical results relate to traffic in the real world. Indeed, 
    some engineering researchers questioned whether elaborate chaos-theory interpretations are 
    needed at all, since at least some of the traffic phenomena the physicists’ theories predicted 
    seemed to be similar to observations that had been appearing in traffic engineering literature under 
    other names for years; observations which had straightforward cause-and-effect explanations.
    E 
    James Banks, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at San Diego State University in the 
    US, suggested that a sudden slowdown in traffic may have less to do with chaos theory than with 
    driver psychology. As traffic gets heavier and the passing lane gets more crowded, aggressive 
    drivers move to other lanes to try to pass, which also tends to even out the speed between lanes. 
    He also felt that another leveling force is that when a driver in a fast lane brakes a little to maintain 
    a safe distance between vehicles, the shock wave travels back much more rapidly than it would in 
    the other slower lanes, because each following driver has to react more quickly. Consequently, as a 
    road becomes congested, the faster moving traffic is the first to slow down.
