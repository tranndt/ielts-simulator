    The life and work of Marie Curie

raw_passage_subtitle: |


raw_passage_text: |
    The marriage of Pierre and Marie Curie in 1895 marked the start of a partnership that was soon to 
    achieve results of world significance. Following Henri Becquerel’s discovery in 1896 of a new 
    phenomenon, which Marie later called ‘radioactivity’, Marie Curie decided to find out if the 
    radioactivity discovered in uranium was to be found in other elements. She discovered that this 
    was true for thorium.
    Turning her attention to minerals, she found her interest drawn to pitchblende, a mineral whose 
    radioactivity, superior to that of pure uranium, could be explained only by the presence in the ore 
    of small quantities of an unknown substance of very high activity. Pierre Curie joined her in the 
    work that she had undertaken to resolve this problem, and that led to the discovery of the new 
    elements, polonium and radium. While Pierre Curie devoted himself chiefly to the physical study 
    of the new radiations, Marie Curie struggled to obtain pure radium in the metallic state. This was 
    achieved with the help of the chemist André-Louis Debierne, one of Pierre Curie’s pupils. Based 
    on the results of this research, Marie Curie received her Doctorate of Science, and in 1903 Marie 
    and Pierre shared with Becquerel the Nobel Prize for Physics for the discovery of radioactivity.
    The births of Marie’s two daughters, Irène and Eve, in 1897 and 1904 failed to interrupt her 
    scientific work. She was appointed lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in 
    Sèvres, France (1900), and introduced a method of teaching based on experimental 
    demonstrations. In December 1904 she was appointed chief assistant in the laboratory directed by 
    Pierre Curie.
    The sudden death of her husband in 1906 was a bitter blow to Marie Curie, but was also a turning 
    point in her career: henceforth she was to devote all her energy to completing alone the scientific 
    work that they had undertaken. On May 13, 1906, she was appointed to the professorship that had 
    been left vacant on her husband’s death, becoming the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne. In 
    1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the isolation of a pure form of radium.
    During World War I, Marie Curie, with the help of her daughter Irène, devoted herself to the 
    development of the use of X-radiography, including the mobile units which came to be known as 
    ‘Little Curies’, used for the treatment of wounded soldiers. In 1918 the Radium Institute, whose 
    staff Irène had joined, began to operate in earnest, and became a centre for nuclear physics and 
    chemistry. Marie Curie, now at the highest point of her fame and, from 1922, a member of the 
    Academy of Medicine, researched the chemistry of radioactive substances and their medical 
    applications.
    In 1921, accompanied by her two daughters, Marie Curie made a triumphant journey to the United 
    States to raise funds for research on radium. Women there presented her with a gram of radium for 
    her campaign. Marie also gave lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain and Czechoslovakia and, in 
    addition, had the satisfaction of seeing the development of the Curie Foundation in Paris, and the 
    inauguration in 1932 in Warsaw of the Radium Institute, where her sister Bronia became director.
    One of Marie Curie’s outstanding achievements was to have understood the need to accumulate 
    intense radioactive sources, not only to treat illness but also to maintain an abundant supply for 
    research. The existence in Paris at the Radium Institute of a stock of 1.5 grams of radium made a 
    decisive contribution to the success of the experiments undertaken in the years around 1930. This 
    work prepared the way for the discovery of the neutron by Sir James Chadwick and, above all, for 
    the discovery in 1934 by Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie of artificial radioactivity. A few months 
    after this discovery, Marie Curie died as a result of leukaemia caused by exposure to radiation. 
    She had often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, remarking on the 
    pretty blue-green light they gave off.
    Her contribution to physics had been immense, not only in her own work, the importance of which 
    had been demonstrated by her two Nobel Prizes, but because of her influence on subsequent 
    generations of nuclear physicists and chemists.
